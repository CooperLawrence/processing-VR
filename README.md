__Virtual Reality software programmed in Processing__ <br>
This entire project has been developed as a hobby during my final year of highschool. It has been successfully tested by a few hundred users at the 2015 Ottawa Maker Faire.

If you would like to view the source files, they are included in the download. The software has yet to be updated to Processing 3, so only run the sketch's source files in Processing 2. You can download Processing 2.2.1 from their [website](https://processing.org/download/), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/processing/processing).
