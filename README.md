__Virtual Reality software programmed in Processing__ <br>
This entire project has been developed as a hobby during my final year of highschool. It has been successfully tested by a few hundred users at the 2015 Ottawa Maker Faire.

The software has yet to be updated to Processing 3, so don't try and use it. You can download Processing 2.2.1 from their [website](https://processing.org), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/processing/processing).
